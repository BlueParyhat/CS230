  The gaming room client was from the show "draw it of lose it". They were looking for software to make a cross platform game looking for the pros and cons to each different platform. I believe I did well in being able articulate the benefits and downsides between the different operating systems to help drive the client into picking the best one for thier needs. Having everything laid out and thought through before just diving into the code is extremely helpful and lets you make much better use of your time. 
  Revisiting the design constraints if something I think I could have done better at and digged deeper into. Being able to really understand what the client wants and what could restrict them on a specific OS can help drive progresss forward much faster.
